## About me

I am an M.S. student at the National University of Defense Technology. My interests include using LLMs more efficient and applying multi-agent architectures to practical problem solving.

My current research focuses on AIOps — using data-driven methods and AI to automate IT operations such as log analysis and incident management. I look forward to connecting and discussing related topics.

## Education

- 2019.6-2023.6 B.S. in Software Engineering, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology

- 2023.9–2026.6 M.S. in Software Engineering, School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology

## Lab & Supervisor

At present, I am studying in the State key laboratory of parallel and distributed processing(PDL), and the supervisor is Academician Huaimin Wang. At the same time, Professor Dawei Feng provides specific guidance with great patience ♥.
